the "Urban Life Community" project is all about creating a virtual hub for city dwellers to connect, engage in activities, and build a stronger sense of community in their urban environment. Whether it's organizing local events or sharing experiences and insights, the platform aims to enhance the overall quality of city life.

  Basically it's been created with HTML, CSS and a piece of JS slider. It can be improved with users pages and login form or else..
